            <h1>My Purpose</h1>
            <p class = "purposewords">Ever since I was little I knew I wanted to do something lego-like.<br>
                     Over the years, I have joined countless small events and clubs to help me narrow down my career interest. I had the help of Girls Who Code, popular youtubers such as Micheal Reeves, and academic teams to explore my interests. I had eventually narrowed down my future career to robotical engineer.<br>
                     However, ever since I took my hardest math class, with the math teacher who has a reputation of being the hardest grader with the hardest math class, i have become unsure of my choice. Now my search includes possible careers such as data analyst and others. Now, comedically enough, I am completely unsure of what I want. One thing I do know however, is I want to work in the STEM field.<br>
                     People have asked me why I love math and physics; why I get excited knowing how a Coca-Cola can opens with its mechanics. Why I adore watching documentaries about the greatest discoveries of mankind.
                     <br>The answer?<br>Innovation<br> 
                     The word that sometimes feels overused, insignificant, and glorified; seeing that word sometimes kills a bit of me because of how many times I hear it. But no matter how you see it, innovation is everywhere.<br>
                     Cars? On the roads. Planes? In the skies. Phones? Look around and there it is. Pi, nuetrons, periodic element Neptunium to Oganesson, etc. All of these things have saved someone, in one way or another.<br>
                     Innovation saves people.<br> My journey in finding out my career is really realizing how I will help people, how I can make someone smile and laugh again with my careers.<br>
                     That is my goal in life.</p>
